        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First, for the pancake batter, put the flour in a bowl. Add the eggs, salt, mineral water, and goat's milk, and mix everything together with a whisk.</p>
                Work quickly to avoid lumps. Then cover the bowl and set the batter aside to rest.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Now wash the spinach thoroughly. Change the water several times if necessary until the spinach is free of sand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Peel the onions and garlic, chop both finely, and sauté in 2 teaspoons of oil. Add the spinach while still wet and sauté over medium heat until the liquid has evaporated.</p>
                 Season to taste with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Set aside and allow to cool slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Wash the cocktail tomatoes and cut them in half. Drain the sheep's cheese and cut it into small pieces. Mix both into the spinach.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Heat 1/2 teaspoon of oil in a coated pan and gradually bake 8 pancakes. Alternatively, bake 6 thicker pancakes to make a total of 6 pancakes.</p>
                 One serving consists of 2 pancakes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Top each pancake with one-eighth (one-sixth) of the filling, roll up, and serve immediately.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
